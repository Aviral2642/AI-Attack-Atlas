# ðŸ§  AI Attack Atlas

The **AI Attack Atlas** is the **most comprehensive mind map** of adversarial techniques, attack surfaces, and pivot paths across **modern AI systems**.

This version (`AI_Attack_Atlas_v2_expanded.opml`) is the **final expanded release**, incorporating:
- **Operator-style decision trees** (inspired by Active Directory attack maps)
- **State-driven branches**: *preconditions â†’ enumeration â†’ exploit â†’ pivot â†’ new goals*
- Coverage of **all AI paradigms**: LLMs, RAG, Agentic AI, RL/RLHF, multimodal, diffusion, federated learning, computer vision, speech, GNNs, and beyond
- **Cross-cutting threats**: prompt injection, jailbreaks, poisoning, model extraction, privacy attacks, adversarial examples, supply-chain compromise, GPU side-channels, economic DoS
- **Named classes & real-world issues**: *LeftoverLocals*, *GPU.zip*, *Morris II*, *Nightshade*, *DolphinAttack*, *Light Commands*
- **Operator playbooks** by foothold (e.g., no creds, API key, RAG KB write access, plugin publisher, neighbor GPU)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The **AI Attack Atlas** is designed to unify the fragmented landscape of AI security research into a **single operator-ready knowledge map**.  

It enables:
- **Red Teamers**: simulate realistic AI attack paths  
- **Defenders**: identify monitoring gaps and security controls  
- **Researchers**: explore overlooked vectors and attack surfaces  
- **Educators**: teach AI security through structured visuals
